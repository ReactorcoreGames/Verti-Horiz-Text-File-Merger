# Verti-Horiz Text File Merger

An offline standalone web app to merge TXT files vertically or append them horizontally.
Made by Reactorcore @ https://reactorcore.itch.io/

## Vertical Stacking

### What it does:
The Vertical Merger combines multiple text files into one, joining them one after another in alphabetical filename order.

### How to use:
- Upload multiple text files by dragging them onto the upload area or clicking "Select Files"
- Files will be automatically sorted alphabetically by filename
- Each file's content will start on a new line
- Preview the result in the text area
- Copy to clipboard or download the merged file

## Horizontal Append

### What it does:
The Horizontal Appender combines two text files line by line, merging corresponding lines from each file.

### How to use:
- Upload a base file (left slot) and an addon file (right slot)
- Choose whether addon lines come before or after base lines
- Enable "Repeat addon lines" to loop addon content if it's shorter
- Enable "Remove extra spaces" to clean up formatting
- Preview the result and copy or download

### Options:
- Addon after base: Places addon text after base text on each line
- Repeat addon: If addon has fewer lines, it loops from the beginning
- Remove extra spaces: Converts multiple spaces to single spaces

This program is free, private and offline. All operations happen locally on your computer, simply using your browser, no data is sent anywhere - you can open the html file in notepad++ or similar to see the source code directly.

Works via any modern web browser, so you can use it on any operating system. Win, mac, linux, android, etc.

I originally made this so I can glue together my AI image generator prompts together (see my cool text generators on my itch.io page) for automation purposes and to avoid tedious manual work, but since this web app is so universally useful, I made available to everyone for free.
